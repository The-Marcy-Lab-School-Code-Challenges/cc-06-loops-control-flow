# Code Challenge: Loops with Control Flow

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function named `countDoubleDigitNumbers` that takes in an integer argument that returns a count of the numbers that are "double digits"(multiples of 11) from  1 to (and including) 1000. 
```
countDoubleDigitNumbers(40) //returns 3 because 11, 22, and 33 are multiples of 11 
```

2. Write a function named `sumOfNotThreeAndFive` that returns the sum of all numbers that are *not* multiples of 3 and multiples of 5 from 1 to 1000.
```
sumOfNotThreeAndFive() //returns 333666
```


### Bonus 
3. Write a function `multiplesOfFourAndFive` that **returns an array** of all positive numbers from 1 to 100 if that number is a multiple of 4 and a mutliple of 5. 
```
multiplesOfFourAndSix() // returns [20,40,50,60]
```
