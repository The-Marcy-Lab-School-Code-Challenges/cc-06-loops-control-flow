# Code Challenge: Loops with Control Flow

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function named `countDoubleDigitNumbers` that takes in an integer argument that returns a **count** of the numbers that are "double digits"(multiples of 11) from  1 to (and including) the given argument. 
```
countDoubleDigitNumbers(44) //returns 4 because 11, 22, 33, and 44 are multiples of 11 
```

2. Write a function named `averageOfNotThreeAndFive` that returns the average of all numbers that are *not* multiples of 3 and  *not* multiples of 5 from 1 to (and including) 1000.
```
averageOfNotThreeAndFive() //returns 502.5 because 33165 divided by 66 is 502.5
```


### Bonus 
3. Write a function `multiplesOfFiveAndSix` that **returns an array** of all positive numbers from 1 to 100 if that number is a multiple of 5 and a mutliple of 6. 
```
multiplesOfFiveAndSix() // returns [ 30, 60, 90 ]
```
